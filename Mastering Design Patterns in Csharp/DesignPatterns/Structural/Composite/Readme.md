# Composite pattern

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern used in software design to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. It is part of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, aimed at simplifying tree-like structures where individual objects and groups of objects can be handled in the same way.
