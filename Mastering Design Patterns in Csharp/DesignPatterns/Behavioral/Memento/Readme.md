# Memento Pattern

The Memento pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to capture its internal state and restore it later. The Memento pattern is implemented with three objects: the originator, a caretaker, and a memento. The originator is an object that has an internal state. The caretaker is an object that holds the memento. The memento is an object that holds the state of the originator.

The app might consume a lot of memory with this pattern.
