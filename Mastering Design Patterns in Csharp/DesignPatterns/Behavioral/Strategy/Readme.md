# Strategy pattern

The Strategy Design Pattern is one of the behavioral design patterns that promotes the encapsulation of interchangeable behaviors within a program. By using this pattern, you can define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one in its own class, and make them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.
